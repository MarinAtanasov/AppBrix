# AppBrix
This framework has been written using the latest version of DNX Core.

AppBrix has been created with the following priorities:
* Everything should be testable and covered with tests.
* Interfaces and their default implementations should be as simple as possible.
* Interfaces should be easy to understand and use.
* Nothing should be dependent on the default implementations.
* Every part of the framework should be easily replaceable without changing the original source code.

## Building the source
Building the source requires [ASP.NET MVC 5 RC1](https://get.asp.net/) and [Web Tools 2015 RC1 Update 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49959).

## Sample Application
AppBrix.ConsoleApp is a simple console application which uses the framework.

## Running Tests
The tests are using xUnit. They require the Test Explorer to be opened before building the test projects in order to discover the tests.
